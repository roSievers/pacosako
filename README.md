An implementation of the game [Paco Ŝako](https://pacosako.com/) as a web app.

## Development

The frontend is written in [Typescript](http://typescriptlang.org/) and packaged
using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/). Run `npm run frontend` in the root folder
to build the frontend and provide the distribution to the server.
This will start Parcel in watch mode.

server framework. Run `npm run start` in the `/server` folder in order to start
a NestJS development server.
